Here You can find python and text files files to design astrolabe in FreeCAD . Load the python file in **FreeCAd/macro/macros..** and enter the radius of astrolabe mater or Um. The design of astrolabe plate depends on latitude of geographic location; therefore, program asks for latitude in decimal degrees and radius of astrolabe. 

Star locations and constellations are depicted in text files Stars.txt and Stars_Constellation_Lines.txt which are necessary for design of astrolabe rete. If you wish to add constellation shape in rete run the Astrolab_rete_Add_Cons_Lines.py 

Desgin of Khojandi Astrolabe also added . Copied from Wilfred De Graaf Paper
